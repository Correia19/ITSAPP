ITS Mobile Application for Traffic Signs - University Project

Introduction:

Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) play a key role in enhancing the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of road networks. One of the main challenges in ITS is the accurate and timely communication of traffic signs, especially in real-time, for both drivers and autonomous vehicles.

The goal of this project is to adapt a previous project developed in C# into a mobile application. Using GPS coordinates and communication with a database, the mobile app detects traffic signs around the user and displays them in real-time. The application provides a clear and quick visualization of traffic signs, optimizing the driving experience, particularly for smart vehicles. Additionally, the app processes the received signs and evaluates their relevance based on the user's geographic location.

Features:

Real-Time Detection: Using GPS coordinates, the application identifies and displays relevant traffic signs as the user moves, offering real-time information.
Signal Processing: Based on the user's location, the signs are processed to ensure only relevant traffic signs are shown, optimizing the driving experience.
Traffic Sign Visualization: The application’s interface clearly and efficiently displays traffic signs, ensuring users have easy access to road information in their vicinity.
API Communication: The application communicates with a database via an API, allowing real-time collection and processing of traffic data.
GPS Technology: Utilizes precise GPS technology to detect the user's exact location and adapt the display of signs according to the current zone.
